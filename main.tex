\begin{abstract}
This document outlines the finite element simulation process conducted to determine the stress and deformation of a 3D printed Hexapod leg. This is the first step in order to optimise the concept design before manufacturing. In order to validate the model, a 2D profile of the design was developed which allowed for simple hand calculations. This 2D Ansys model will then be used to validate a 3D model of the Hexapod leg design.

\section{Introduction}
3D printing is a manufacturing process from which solid objects can be made from digital files. This is achieved by repeatedly melting and laying down material in layers until the object is formed. This process is becoming popular within households as the 3D printers are gradually becoming commercially affordable. The standard commercial printer is typically able to print using either Polylactic Acid (PLA) or Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Since the hexapod leg is to experience impact forces, ABS was chosen due to it's properties of being much stronger, more flexible and machinable compared to PLA.

Failure points and maximum stresses can be analysed either experimentally or by using simulation software such as ANSYS. The theoretical method, through ANSYS simualtion software, is applied in this document to a 2D model and validated through hand calculations. This 2D model can then be used to validate the 3D simulations before optimisation is conducted.

\section{Project Requirements and Plan}

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.


\subsection{How to add Comments}

Comments can be added to your project by clicking on the comment icon in the toolbar above. % * <john.hammersley@gmail.com> 2016-07-03T09:54:16.211Z:
%
% Here's an example comment!
%
To reply to a comment, simply click the reply button in the lower right corner of the comment, and you can close them when you're done.

Comments can also be added to the margins of the compiled PDF using the todo command\todo{Here's a comment in the margin!}, as shown in the example on the right. You can also add inline comments:

\todo[inline, color=green!40]{This is an inline comment.}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 


\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.
